# Views of the Land
Final project for Map 701 - https://marybecker.github.io/Map701FinalProject/

The European colonists used surveys and maps to support colonial claims to territory in what is now called New England.    This map is part of a private collection and is made available in [digital format through the Norman B. Leventhal Map Center Collection](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f462s90h).  It is the first printed map of William Reed’s  survey of 1665.  The survey was commissioned by Massachusetts authorities to support the colonial boundaries that were described in the first Massachusetts Charter of 1628.  The concept of claiming and owning the land was a vastly different viewpoint from the indigenous communities that called the land their home.  In contrast, the land was viewed as something to be honored and treasured, not exploited and “owned” 5.
